#lhasa

A simple sound file looper/explorer built with [p5 js][https://p5js.org] and [Tone js](https://tonejs.github.io/). Super loosely based on the [fm3 buddha machine](http://www.fm3buddhamachine.com/v2/). Kinda.
**VERY WIP**

Things to add
- Volume control
- Pitch control
- A way to chose samples
- Better samples (lolz)
- User sample upload (drag and drop). Maybe.
